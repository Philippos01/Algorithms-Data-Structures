## About the Repository

This repository is about some assignments based on data structures and algorithmic implementations.
Each assignment concerns a different scientific subject that needs to be optimized with the usage of algorithms written in a programming language(Python 3.10.2).
Specifically, the exact topic for each assignment is:

* [Sorted Integers Compression & Decompression](https://github.com/Philippos01/Algorithms-Data-Structures/blob/main/assignment-2022-1/README.md)
* [Sequence Alignment](https://github.com/Philippos01/Algorithms-Data-Structures/blob/main/assignment-2022-2/README.md)
* [Cycle Detection in a sequence of numbers](https://github.com/Philippos01/Algorithms-Data-Structures/blob/main/assignment-2022-3/README.md)
